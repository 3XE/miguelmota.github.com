	<p>Why hello there,</p>
	<p>I'm <strong>Miguel Mota</strong>, a 19 year old freelance web developer from the always sunny Southern California.
	I create simple, user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing websites. I'm an awesome ninja at XHTML/CSS, Javascript(jQuery) and PHP/SQL.</p>
	
	<p>I am currently a college student with 1+ years of experience in web developing and would love to make this a full-time job someday.
	If you need help with an existing site or would like to start from scratch then I <em>might</em> be what you are looking for.</p>
	
	<p>For questions, comments or simply to talk, you can reach me at <a href='mailto:hello@miguelmota.com'>hello@miguelmota.com</a>. =]</p>
