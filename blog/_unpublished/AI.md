agents is anything whos input received through sensor (ie camera,mic)
outputs response through actuator (anything it can use to output response through)
performance measure - acting intelligently
agents operate in an environment
environemnt props impact design (funcs) of agent program
In T(n) = O(2n)
T = time complexity
n = n is the amount of computations required or the amount of inputs sent to the algorithms
O = Big O notation - "pretty much" - worse case scenerio
 best to have an algorithm with linear or logarithmic scale, no exponential

 coursera

 the ability to identify and select appropriate activity
 and project the consequences of executing that activity

 utility theory: "preferred outcomes"
 decision theory: probability theoryy + utility theory. Agents that can affect utility.
