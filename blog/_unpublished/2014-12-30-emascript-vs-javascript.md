ECMAScript is the name of the standard, language specification, that composes what we know as "JavaScript". In the beginning, Brendan Eich created a language that took the good features of various programming languages, which he wanted to resemble Java a bit but much easier to grasp, hence called it JavaScript (it was a marketing ploy as well to deter from Java). Believe it or not JavaScript was created in just 10 days due do a harsh deadline set by Netscape before Microsoft released a browser. Initially *Java*, owned by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), owned a trademark on Java, hence JavaScript could not be used by everyone except Mozilla due to a license received by Sun. JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript.

Java for it's syntax and primitive values versus objects.
Scheme and AWK for it's first-class functions.
Self for it's prototypal inheritance
Perl and Python for it's strings, arrays, and regular expression
