perceptron: has multiple inputs, outputs single value if threshold reached

x = value
w = weights (importance)

x1w1
x2w2 > output
x3w3

using a *bias* value instead of a threshold, which is a measure of how easy it is to get perceptron to output a 1

       0 if w * x + b <= 0
output 1 if w * x =b > 0
