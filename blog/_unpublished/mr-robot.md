I remember a few people wondering why Elliot would wipe his computer and then just put all his data on CDs where people could find it.
In this episode (S01E08), we finally see him read a CD.. and he's using DeepSound, which allows him to hide encrypted data inside an audio file. Meaning if someone were to use the CD, it would look and play just like it should.
