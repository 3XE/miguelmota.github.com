<p>Creating CSS triangles shouldn't be hard.</p>

<p>Here's a handy little mixin for creating triangles in Sass (<a href="https://gist.github.com/miguelmota/5327822" target="_blank">gist</a>):</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/miguelmota/5327822.js"></script>

<p>I'm using this mixin to create the transparent downward facing traingle on the bottom of the large header, as seen on the <a href="/about">about</a> page.</p>
