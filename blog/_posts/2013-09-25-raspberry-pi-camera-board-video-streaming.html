<p>So you got your <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> and decided to get a <a href="http://downloads.element14.com/raspberry-pi-camera/" target="_blank">Camera Board</a> to do something awesome with it. Why not turn it a simple video streamer? That's what I thought too. I wanted to set up a simple security camera for my home so that I can see spy on whoever is lurking around from wherever I am through a web browser. Turns out it wasn't hard at all to set up. This <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/stream-video-from-the-raspberry-pi-camera-to-web-browsers-even-on-ios-and-android" target="_blank">blog post</a> helped me get started. I'm going to walk you through all the steps I took.</p>

<h2>Installing Raspbian</h2>

<p>I want to point out that I am using the Debian based <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/" target="_blank">Raspbian</a> operaing system. I followed this <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup" target="_blank">article</a> on how to make the bootable SD card. Basically all I did was download the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads" target="_blank">Raspbian img</a>, unmount the SD card, and ran the <code>dd</code> command (on Ubuntu).</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# List the mounted media devices.
df -h

# Unmount SD card to be able to write the img on to it.
# Important that you make sure you are unmounting the correct device.
umount /dev/sdd1

# Now write the img file.
# Adjust the input file path to your own.
# VERY IMPORTANT that the output path is pointing to your SD card.
# If not set correctly it can possibly corrupt your hard drive.
sudo dd bs=4M if=~/Downloads/2013-05-25-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdd

# Be patient. It might take a minute or two to copy the Raspbian img on the SD card.
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Installing MJPG Streamer</h2>

<p>After booting up your Raspberry Pi, install <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mjpg-streamer/" target="_blank">MJPG Streamer</a>.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Make and change into directory.
sudo mkdir /opt/mjpg-streamer
cd /opt/mjpg-streamer/

# Install the following packages.
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
sudo apt-get install subversion

# Download MJPG Streamer into the current directory.
sudo svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/mjpg-streamer/code/mjpg-streamer/ .

# Run make.
sudo make
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you get the following error:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
linux/videodev.h: No such file or directory
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Make sure you have <code>libv4l-dev</code> installed and create a symbolic link for the header file:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
sudo ln -s /usr/include/libv4l1-videodev.h /usr/include/linux/videodev.h
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Start capturing</h2>

<p>Alright now for the fun part. Streaming the video.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Make a directory to store the temporary images.
sudo mkdir /tmp/stream/

# Start capturing.
# To see what the options are, run: raspistill -h
# You see the record light turn after executing this line.
raspistill -w 640 -h 480 -q 5 -o /tmp/stream/pic.jpg -tl 100 -t 9999999 -th 0:0:0 -n -v &

# While still in the /opt/mjpg-streamer/ directory, 
# run the following to start up the MJPG Streamer streaming webserver.
# To see what the options are, run: ./mjpg_streamer -h
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./ ./mjpg_streamer -i "input_file.so -f /tmp/stream" -o "output_http.so -p 9000 -w ./www" &
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If everything went smoothly you can open up a web browser and go to:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
http://<your-raspberry-pi-ip-address>:9000/
{% endhighlight %}

<p>There you have it. To access your streaming webserver remotely you will need to enable port forwarding on your router. Since every router is different I can't explain how, but the <a href="http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/" target="_blank">PortForward</a> site can guide you.</p>

<h2>Stopping stream</h2>

<p>To stop capturing and turn of the webserver we must kill the <code>raspistill</code> and <code>mjpg</code> processes that are running in the background.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Find the proccess id of `raspistill` and kill it.
pgrep raspistill
kill <process id>

# Find the proccess id of `mjpg` and kill it.
pgrep mjpg
kill <process id>
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The possibilities are endless on the things you can do with a Raspberry Pi. I hope this tutorial helped you get started with simple video streaming on the Raspberry Pi using the awesome camera board module. Leave a comment if this post was useful or not. There is always room for improvement.</p>
