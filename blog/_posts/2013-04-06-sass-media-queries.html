description: SASS media queries to set breakpoints.
---
<p>There are various methods of setting breakpoints in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a>. The first method, which I use, is heavility inspired by <a href="https://gist.github.com/chriseppstein/1215856" target="blank">Chris Eppstein's selector hacks</a>. The second method is how <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/media-queries.html" target="blank">ZURB's Foundation 4</a> breakpoints are set.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/miguelmota/5316827" target="_blank">gist</a>:
