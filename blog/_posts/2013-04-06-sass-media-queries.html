<p>There are various methods of setting breakpoints in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SASS</a>. The first method, which I use, is heavility inspired by <a href="https://gist.github.com/chriseppstein/1215856" target="blank" rel="nofollow">Chris Eppstein's selector hacks</a>. The second method is how <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/media-queries.html" target="blank" rel="nofollow">ZURB's Foundation 4</a> breakpoints are set.</p>
