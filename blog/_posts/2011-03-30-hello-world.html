<p>Why hello there, and welcome to my blog. I am using <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll' rel='external'>jekyll</a>, a static site generator, and it's being hosted on <a href='http://pages.github.com/' rel='external'>GitHub Pages</a>. 
I will blog about all things web, usually about code and design tips, tricks and techniques.</p>
<p>So yep, that's pretty much it!</p>
