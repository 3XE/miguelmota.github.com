<p>Why hello there, and welcome to my blog. I am using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">jekyll</a>, a static site generator, and it is being hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.
I will blog about all things web, usually about code and design tips, tricks and techniques.</p>

<p>So yep, that's pretty much it!</p>
