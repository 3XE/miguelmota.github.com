description: A simple url shortening service with stats.
---
<p>Everyone now-a-days seems to have their own url shortening service, such as goo.gl, t.co, youtu.be, fb.me, git.io, and so on.</p>

<p>So I thought I'd have my own as well, and therefore <a href="http://mig.gs" target="_blank">mig.gs</a> was born.</p>

<p><a href="http://mig.gs" target="_blank">mig.gs</a> offers basic analytics using <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/" target="_blank">Google Charts API</a> to display daily clicks and generate a QR code. It also displays a Google map of your link visitors by using their IP Address. You can make an account to save your links or use a custom word instead of a random code if you'd like, kind of like bit.ly</p>
