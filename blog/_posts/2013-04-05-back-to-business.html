description: Been busy these past few months, but it's back to business.
---
<p>I originally started this blog back in 2009 with the intentions of periodically writing posts on all things web.. but that obviously hasn't happen.</p>

<p>Since 2009 I've only have had 8 posts. Yep 8 posts total. I have been hammered and beat by school and work, and rarely have any free time anymore. But it's time to get back to business. I am learning something new everyday and I feel that I need to contribute back to the community.</p>

<p><em>No more procrastination</em>. <strong>More writing</strong>.</p>

<p>My goal at the moment is to write an article at least once a week. I need to get into the habit until it becomes natural. I've been obsessed with JavaScript lately and hope to kick it off with some tutorials on various frameworks/libraries.</p>
