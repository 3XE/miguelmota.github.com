<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization" target="_blank">Memoization</a> (based on the word memorable) is technique that caches the result of a function in order to avoid recalculation the next time the same function is called. Initially when the function is executed, the result gets added to an object holding the calculated results. When the function is called again, it checks the results object to see if already contains the result and if it does then return it. If it's not cached, then calculate and store it. The code below is a modified version of the memoization example that I came across as I was reading <a href="http://jsninja.com/" target=_blank"><em>Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</em></a> by <a href="http://ejohn.org/" target="_blank">John Resig</a>. I also added bit of code to store the result in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/" target="_blank">local storage</a> so that we keep a copy of the results even after the page is refreshed.

<p>Finding prime numbers is just a simple example. Where memoization shines is where complex algorithmic function take time to retun a value. It would be time expensive, for example if you were running an HTML5 game where the canvas needs to get redrawn 30 times a second, to execute the same time consuming function over and over again. With memoization the function only runs once (assuming the same parameters were passed in) and the result is cached for future use.</p>
